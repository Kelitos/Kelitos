Hi, I’m @Kelitos and for some time now I've been trying to break into cyber security. I finally got the courage to track all of my achivements
throughout this journey of "breaking into cyber security". I am a recent college graduate with a bachelors degree in IT with a concentration in 
cyber security. I felt like my time in college was a waste of time since the cyber security program at the university was not ideally not the best.
It consisted more of coding and most of the professors would just come to class and read off of the screen without going in to detail on the subject
(I should've done more research on the cyber security program but money was an issue and this university was something that I could afford).It wasn't
until my last year of college that I actually started studying for the CompTIA Sec+ as I wanted to stand out when applying out jobs as one of my friends
had mentioned it to me. After I had gotten that certification, I did not know what else to go for and decided to hop right in to TryHackMe and advance
my knowledge in the security field by learning from their paths. I have being doing TryHackMe for quite sometime now and have managed to learn more than 
I have ever done attending college. One good thing that actually benifited me that came from attending college was the connections I've made throughout 
my four years. I've met people who are smarter than me and actually two who have impacted my life tremendously. They are the IT Security Analyst and the
Network Specialist on campus. I've met them through the job that I had adquired on campus as a student tech support for faculty and students. They have
been so helpful ever since I've told them about my situation and they even gave me an intership to work alongside them. They gave me access to Cisco's AMP
for Endpoints and Cisco Umbrella....... 

Anyways, I know this might be a long story to read but I just wanted to share my exprience so far and wanted to domument my work that I will be doing on TryHackMe.
 
THANK YOU!
